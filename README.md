# TLDR Terms
  
Use AI to instantly summarize websites' terms of service, while highlighting any potentially concerning elements. Uses the Google Gemini API via a [backend server](https://github.com/heyseth/TLDR_Terms_Server).

The most common lie on the internet: "I have read and agree to the terms." This project aims to fix this.
  
## Features
